/**
 * CipherStash v3 baseline migration — install the EQL v3 bundle.
 *
 * The install SQL IS baked into `ops.json`, embedded by this self-emit
 * script from the installed `@cipherstash/eql` and verified against the
 * release manifest's `installSqlSha256` before emission (see
 * `../../src/migration/eql-bundle-v3.ts` for the full rationale: the
 * framework treats migration packages as immutable-by-dirName and applies
 * them from disk without the descriptor, so the artefact's bytes ARE the
 * migration). The bundle creates the 40 `public.eql_v3_*` storage domains,
 * the `eql_v3` operator-function schema (`eql_v3.eq`, `eql_v3.ord_term`, …),
 * the `eql_v3.query_*` operand domains, and the `eql_v3_internal` helper
 * schema.
 *
 * This is the genesis migration of the cipherstash contract space (the
 * package is EQL v3 only), and it is an **invariant-only genesis edge**:
 * the v3 bundle declares no contract-space storage (no config table),
 * so `describe()` returns `from: null → to: <the empty-storage hash>`.
 * The edge exists to carry the `cipherstash:install-eql-v3-bundle-v1`
 * invariant: the apply-path planner (`findPathWithInvariants`) walks it
 * when the head ref requires that invariant.
 *
 * PUBLISHED — DO NOT RE-EMIT. This package's bytes are content-addressed
 * into consumer repos; a re-emit that changes them orphans every vendored
 * copy. An EQL version bump ships as a NEW upgrade migration directory
 * (see `20260720T0000_upgrade_eql_v3_3_0_2`), never as an edit here.
 * (One authorized pre-GA re-emit happened on the 1.0 release branch: the
 * install op was reclassified `data` → `additive`, the baked bundle was
 * bumped to eql-3.0.4, and a no-SQL carrier op per upgrade invariant
 * (3.0.2 and 3.0.4) was added so fresh-database `db init` passes its
 * additive-only policy. Both the `migrationHash` and the baked
 * `installSqlSha256` changed. RC consumers must delete
 * `migrations/cipherstash/` and re-run `prisma-next migration plan` to
 * pick up the re-emitted artefacts.)
 *
 * Authoring loop (pre-publication only): hand-edit, then re-emit
 * `ops.json` / `migration.json` via
 * `pnpm exec tsx migrations/20260601T0100_install_eql_v3_bundle/migration.ts`.

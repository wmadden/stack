/**
 * Typed-narrowing helpers for the on-disk contract-space JSON artefacts
 * the cipherstash control descriptor wires into its
 * `SqlControlExtensionDescriptor`.
 *
 * JSON-imported values come back as widened, structurally-typed
 * objects: branded fields (`storageHash: StorageHashBase<string>`) and
 * discriminated unions (`MigrationPlanOperation['operationClass']`)
 * fall back to plain strings, so a direct assignment into the
 * descriptor surfaces is a type error. The cipherstash MVP previously
 * suppressed that error with `as unknown as X` triple-casts, which
 * silently masks any future shape drift between the emitted JSON and
 * the in-package descriptor.
 *
 * This module replaces the blind casts with thin runtime assertions
 * that fail fast on drift and narrow the JSON inputs to the framework
 * types in a single, auditable place. The assertions are intentionally
 * minimal — they check the canonical discriminator fields (`storageHash`,
 * `space`, `dirName`, `operationClass`, …) rather than re-validating
 * the whole emitter contract — which is enough to surface schema-level
 * drift while keeping the descriptor module light.

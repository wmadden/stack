/**
 * Cipherstash-internal `RUNTIME.ABORTED` phase wrapping.
 *
 * The framework`s `runtimeAborted(phase)` (`@prisma/orm-framework/
 * components/runtime`) constructs the canonical `RUNTIME.ABORTED`
 * envelope (`code === 'RUNTIME.ABORTED'`, `category === 'RUNTIME'`,
 * `details.phase`, `cause`) but its `phase` parameter is typed as
 * the framework`s closed `RuntimeAbortedPhase` union — `encode`,
 * `decode`, `stream`, `beforeExecute`, `afterExecute`, `onRow`. Those
 * tags describe phases of `runtime.execute()` itself (see ADR 207`s
 * "Where the runtime observes abort" table); cipherstash`s async
 * observation points sit one layer outside the framework runtime:
 *
 *   - `bulk-encrypt`  — the bulk-encrypt middleware`s SDK round-trip
 *     inside `beforeExecute`. Conceptually a sub-phase of the
 *     framework`s `beforeExecute`, but tag-wise distinct so callers
 *     can attribute the abort to the cipherstash SDK call rather
 *     than to a generic middleware step.
 *   - `decrypt`       — the single-cell `EncryptedString#decrypt()`
 *     SDK call, invoked by the application after the framework
 *     returns the row. Not inside any framework phase.
 *   - `decrypt-all`   — the `decryptAll` walker`s `bulkDecrypt` calls,
 *     invoked by the application after the framework returns the
 *     row set. Not inside any framework phase.
 *
 * Rather than widen the framework union (which would conflate
 * extension-specific tags with the framework`s own attribution
 * sites), this module reuses the framework`s `runtimeError(...)`
 * envelope builder directly — the *envelope shape* (the
 * `RuntimeErrorEnvelope` interface, the `code` slot, the `category`
 * slot, the `details.phase` slot, the `cause` field) is unchanged;
 * only the set of legal `phase` string values grows. ADR 027`s
 * envelope contract is preserved bit-for-bit.
 *
 * The `raceCipherstashAbort` helper mirrors framework
 * `raceAgainstAbort` so cipherstash`s SDK-call sites get the same
 * "return promptly even when the SDK ignores the signal" behaviour
 * (the cooperative-cancellation model from ADR 207). Identity-
 * checked sentinel rejection distinguishes abort-source from a
 * codec-thrown envelope, matching the framework`s pattern. We
 * duplicate the logic (rather than passing a cast tag to the
 * framework helper) to keep the cipherstash `phase` strings
 * cipherstash-internal — no widening of the framework union.

 * through unchanged — only the cipherstash-installed listener ever
 * rejects with the local sentinel reference, so an `error ===

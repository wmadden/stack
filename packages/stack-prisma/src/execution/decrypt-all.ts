/**
 * `decryptAll` — read-side bulk-decrypt walker.
 *
 * Public utility users invoke after `findMany` (or any other read
 * surface) to materialize the plaintext for every cipherstash envelope
 * (any `EncryptedEnvelopeBase` subclass — string / double / bigint /
 * date / boolean / json) reachable from the result set in a fixed
 * number of bulk SDK round-trips:
 *
 *     const rows = await db.select(...).from(User).execute();
 *     await decryptAll(rows);
 *     // every envelope's `decrypt()` now returns plaintext synchronously.
 *
 * Why a separate utility (rather than middleware that auto-decrypts on
 * every read): the framework`s streaming-read path cannot bulk-amortize
 * decryption across rows it`s yielding incrementally — by the time row
 * N is yielded, rows 1..N-1 have already been delivered to the caller.
 * The `decryptAll` shape lets the caller buffer the result set
 * explicitly (with `await stream.toArray()`) and then opt into bulk
 * decryption in one round-trip per `(table, column)` group. The runtime
 * descriptor wrapper deliberately does NOT register an implicit-decrypt
 * middleware for this reason.
 *
 * **Walker shape**.
 *
 * - Recursive on plain objects + plain arrays only. Date / Map / Set /
 *   typed arrays / Buffer / function / etc. are not recursed into:
 *   cipherstash envelopes are user data and would not normally embed
 *   inside these host containers; if a future caller needs to bulk-
 *   decrypt envelopes inside such a container they extract them into a
 *   plain row first. The narrow scope keeps the walker`s behavior
 *   trivially predictable and avoids the cycle / iterator / lazy-eval
 *   surface those exotic types bring.
 * - Cycle-safe via a `WeakSet` of visited objects/arrays; the same
 *   envelope appearing in N positions is collected once.
 * - Skips envelopes whose plaintext slot is already populated
 *   (write-side envelopes from `EncryptedString.from(plaintext)`, or
 *   read-side envelopes already materialized by a prior
 *   `decrypt()` / `decryptAll(...)`). The skip means a re-run is a
 *   no-op and a mixed write/read row tree only round-trips for the
 *   envelopes that need it.
 *
 * **Grouping**. Envelopes are grouped by `(sdk, table, column)` —
 * routing key plus the envelope handle`s SDK reference. The SDK split
 * preserves the per-tenant SDK isolation `runtime.ts`'s docblock spells
 * out: each tenant constructs its own runtime descriptor with its own
 * SDK so per-tenant key material never crosses runtimes. Envelopes from
 * different tenants happening to share `(table, column)` therefore
 * still receive separate `bulkDecrypt` calls.
 *
 * **Cancellation**. `opts.signal` is forwarded by identity to every
 * `bulkDecrypt` call via `ifDefined` — the same shape the bulk-encrypt
 * middleware and `EncryptedString.decrypt({ signal? })` use. The
 * walker also races each SDK promise against `opts.signal` via
 * `raceCipherstashAbort` so an abort surfaces `RUNTIME.ABORTED
 * { phase: 'decrypt-all' }` promptly even when the SDK body itself
 * ignores the signal. A pre-check before the first SDK round-trip
 * short-circuits when the signal is already aborted at entry; the
 * no-envelopes-reachable fast path returns immediately without
 * observing the signal.

/**
 * Walk a result set and bulk-decrypt every cipherstash envelope (any
 * `EncryptedEnvelopeBase` subclass) reachable from it. After the
 * returned promise resolves, every touched envelope's `decrypt()`
 * returns the cached plaintext synchronously without consulting the
 * SDK. Heterogeneous result sets are supported — envelopes of
 * different concrete types (e.g. `EncryptedString` and
 * `EncryptedDate` reachable from the same row) are grouped by
 * `(sdk, table, column)` and the SDK's polymorphic `bulkDecrypt`
 * return is narrowed per envelope through each subclass's
 * {@link EncryptedEnvelopeBase.parseDecryptedValue} hook.
 *
 * The walker is a no-op when no envelopes are reachable (returns
 * without making any SDK call), so it is cheap to call defensively
 * after queries that may or may not contain encrypted columns.

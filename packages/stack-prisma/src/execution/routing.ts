/**
 * Routing-key derivation for cipherstash bulk operations.
 *
 * The routing key is derived from the envelope handle's
 * `(table, column)` — there is no per-column override surface. Every
 * cipherstash envelope passing through the v3 bulk-encrypt middleware
 * (and `decryptAll`) carries `(table, column)` on its handle, populated
 * by the routing-key AST walk ({@link stampRoutingKeysFromAst}) before
 * the bulk-encrypt phase begins.
 *
 * `groupByRoutingKey` produces one homogeneous group per
 * `(table, column)` pair so each `bulkEncrypt` call serves a single
 * routing key — matching the SDK's
 * `bulkEncrypt({ routingKey, values, signal })` shape. Heterogeneous
 * batching is a future optimization.

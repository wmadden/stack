/**
 * The v3 QUERY-TERM seam — the tiny contract between three modules:
 *
 *   - `./operators-v3` MARKS: every v3 predicate operator wraps its
 *     operand in a per-castAs envelope and stamps the query flavour it
 *     needs (`markV3QueryTerm`) before binding the envelope as a
 *     `pg/text@1` param.
 *   - `./bulk-encrypt-v3` COLLECTS: the middleware recognises marked
 *     envelopes among the plan params (they carry no v3 codec id — the
 *     `pg/text@1` binding keeps them out of the storage jurisdiction)
 *     and forwards the envelope itself through `CipherstashSdk.bulkEncrypt`
 *     so the mark survives the SDK boundary.
 *   - `./sdk-adapter-v3` ROUTES: the SDK adapter reads the mark
 *     (`v3QueryTermTypeOf`) and encrypts marked envelopes via the stack
 *     client's `encryptQuery({ queryType })` — a ciphertext-free term —
 *     instead of the storage `bulkEncrypt` path.
 *
 * Extracted from `./operators-v3` so the middleware and SDK adapter can
 * consume the seam without importing the operator registry (and its
 * `@prisma/orm-family-sql/operations` / expression machinery). The operator
 * module re-exports everything here, so its public surface is unchanged.

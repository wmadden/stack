 * rejects the flag outright, so routing Drizzle through it would provision a
 * v2 database while every other integration (and a bare `stash eql install`)
 * gets v3. That also contradicts the stash-drizzle skill installed into the
 * very same project, which documents the v3 surface (`types.*` domains,
 * `Encryption`) and would have the user's agent author v3 code against a v2
 * database. `stash eql migration --drizzle` (added in #691) closes that gap:
 * v3 SQL, still migration-first, and it bundles the `cs_migrations` tracking
 * schema so one `drizzle-kit migrate` covers everything `stash encrypt` needs.
 *
 * **Supabase.** Same migration-first shape, different motivation. A direct
 * install works, and then `supabase db reset` — the ordinary local development
 * loop — drops the database and replays supabase/migrations/, taking EQL with
 * it. Writing the install into that directory is the only way it survives
 * (#613). It also means one `db reset` provisions everything `stash encrypt`
 * needs, since the emitted SQL carries `cs_migrations` too. Gated on local CLI
 * scaffolding: a project pointed at a hosted Supabase database with no
 * `supabase/` directory has nowhere to write and no `supabase` binary to apply
 * it with, so it must keep installing directly.
 *
 * Drizzle wins when both signals fire — it owns the migration history there,
 * and `--supabase` degrades to the grants modifier it has always been on that
 * path. `initCommand`'s apply-step routing makes the same call, for the same
 * reason. The `&&` short-circuit keeps the filesystem probe off every
 * non-Supabase project.

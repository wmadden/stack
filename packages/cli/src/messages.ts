     * had the SQL applied — where the back-dated version is a gap in the middle
     * of history that `db push` otherwise refuses to step over.
     *
     * "Typically" is doing dangerous work in that paragraph, which is why the
     * message prints a check rather than a premise. Every other remedy here

     * and cannot. On a remote that does NOT have EQL — misremembered, a
     * different environment, reset since — the row asserts SQL that never ran,
     * so the version is permanently pending-free: no future `db push` will ever
     * install EQL, and the first migration touching `eql_v3` fails with nothing
     * in the history pointing at the cause.

     * The check is `eql_v3.version()` rather than the more obvious probe for the
     * `eql_v3` schema because of where each object sits in the bundle. The

     * aborted partway; `version()` is created by its closing ones, so it

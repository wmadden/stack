// Unknown keys in an options object are rejected, not silently dropped (#144).
//
// Every test here casts past the TypeScript types on purpose. Those types are
// the first line of defence and catch these mistakes at compile time (#142) —
// but only for TypeScript callers. Plain JS, Deno without type-checking, and
// anything arriving through a `JSON.parse` boundary reach serde unchecked, and
// this is what happens to them there.
//
// The wasm half lives in `wasm-round-trip.test.ts` (`wasm newClient
// validation`), where the wasm loader already is. It matters more there: on
// that boundary serde only sees keys a struct declares, so rejecting anything
// at all takes the `DenyUnknown` marker in `crates/protect-ffi/src/lib.rs`.

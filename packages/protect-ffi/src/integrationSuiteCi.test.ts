/**
 * Guards that the `integration-tests/` suite is RUN, not merely present.

 * Upstream (`cipherstash/protectjs-ffi`) ran these 19 files on every pull
 * request — `mise setup` then `mise run test:integration:all`, in
 * `.github/workflows/test.yml`. The absorption copied the suite into this
 * package intact and left that workflow behind under
 * `packages/protect-ffi/.github/`, where GitHub never looks: it reads workflows
 * from the repository root alone. So the day protect-ffi landed in the
 * monorepo, every live encrypt / decrypt / lock-context / keyset /
 * JSON-SteVec / Postgres / WASM-round-trip assertion in it stopped executing —
 * and a suite that never starts reads exactly like a suite that passes.
 *
 * The property under test is therefore the same one `lintWiring.test.ts`
 * defends for the cargo checks, one level up: a suite nothing invokes is the
 * failure, and it is invisible by construction. This file reads the ROOT
 * workflow directory, so the deposited upstream copy cannot satisfy it.

 * deleting the `Build the protect-ffi binding` STEP from
 * integration-protect-ffi.yml left `build-ffi-binding` in six comments and two
 * `paths:` entries, and the check stayed green. Deleting the
 * `Require CipherStash secrets` step left it in a comment and a `paths:` entry.
 * Dropping `mise run setup` left `mise setup` in the header comment quoting
 * what upstream ran. Three guards, all green, none of them guarding anything.
 *
 * Cutting at `jobs:` is what removes the `on:` / `paths:` block, and that is
 * also what makes the discovery filter below mean what its comment says: a
 * `paths:` filter naming the suite is a trigger, not a run.
 *
 * `nativeLoading.test.ts` strips comments from the emitted entry for the same
 * reason — a comment describing a thing is indistinguishable from the thing.

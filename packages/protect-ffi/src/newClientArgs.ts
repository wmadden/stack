 * key by name (#144) — but it also means an unknown key now reaches neon's
 * `Json` extractor, which is `JSON.stringify`. A circular value or a `bigint`
 * throws there, before serde runs, and the `TypeError` says only `Converting
 * circular structure to JSON`. `newClient({...appConfig, logger})` is the shape
 * that hits it, and on a change whose point is naming the offender that is the
 * wrong failure.
 *
 * Only the forwarded keys are checked. `clientOpts` and the auth strategy are
 * handled above and never reach here, and a circular `encryptConfig` fails the
 * same way it always has — this covers exactly what forwarding newly exposed,
 * for the cost of one `JSON.stringify` of the config at client construction.
 *
 * A key whose value is a function or a symbol is NOT caught: `JSON.stringify`
 * drops those without throwing, so they stay a silent drop on this binding
 * while wasm rejects them. That asymmetry is in the CHANGELOG.
 *
 * Interim. #150 replaces this whole error layer with codes derived in Rust.

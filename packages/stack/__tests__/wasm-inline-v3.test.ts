/**
 * `@cipherstash/stack/wasm-inline` is EQL v3 only (#614). This pins the things
 * that make that true and keep working:
 *
 *   1. The factory always constructs the client with `eqlVersion: 3` — a
 *      v2-mode client cannot resolve the concrete `eql_v3_*` domains and would
 *      fail every encrypt. Only the gated Deno e2e exercises the real wire
 *      format, so this asserts the plumbing the e2e's effect depends on.
 *   2. It still normalises SDK-facing `cast_as` to the EQL-native variant the
 *      WASM client accepts (v3 columns carry `cast_as: 'string'`, not `'text'`).
 *   3. It rejects a v2 table with a clear message rather than pinning v3 wire to
 *      a v2 schema and failing opaquely inside the FFI.
 *   4. That message does not refer the reader on to the native entry for v2
 *      authoring, and `config.eqlVersion` is rejected here exactly as the native
 *      entry rejects it (#815). #815 exists because the two entries disagreed
 *      about v2; a guard on only one of them would reopen it.
 *   5. The runtime `!schemas.length` guard actually runs — it was previously
 *      pinned only by a `@ts-expect-error` type test, which never executes.
 *
 * It also pins that the v3 authoring surface is re-exported from this entry, so
 * an edge consumer authors v3 schemas from a single import.

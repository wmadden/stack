/**
 * WASM-inline entry for `@cipherstash/stack` — for Deno, Bun, Cloudflare
 * Workers, Supabase Edge Functions, and any runtime where the native
 * `@cipherstash/protect-ffi` NAPI bindings are unavailable.
 *
 * Mirrors the protect-ffi / auth `/wasm-inline` pattern: the WASM module
 * is inlined into the JS bundle as a base64 blob (no separate `.wasm`
 * fetch / file read), so this entry works in environments that disallow
 * `fs` or relative asset loading.
 *
 * Use this import path: `@cipherstash/stack/wasm-inline`
 *
 * This entry is EQL v3: author schemas with the `types` DSL / `encryptedTable`
 * re-exported here (the same authoring surface as `@cipherstash/stack/eql/v3`).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import {
 *   Encryption, encryptedTable, types,
 * } from "@cipherstash/stack/wasm-inline"
 *
 * const users = encryptedTable("users", { email: types.TextSearch("email") })
 *
 * const client = await Encryption({
 *   schemas: [users],
 *   config: {
 *     workspaceCrn: Deno.env.get("CS_WORKSPACE_CRN")!,
 *     accessKey:    Deno.env.get("CS_CLIENT_ACCESS_KEY")!,
 *     clientId:     Deno.env.get("CS_CLIENT_ID")!,
 *     clientKey:    Deno.env.get("CS_CLIENT_KEY")!,
 *   },
 * })
 *
 * // Every fallible method returns `{ data } | { failure }` — the same
 * // contract as the native entry. Unwrap before use.
 * const enc = await client.encrypt("alice@example.com", {
 *   column: users.email,
 *   table: users,
 * })
 * if (enc.failure) throw new Error(enc.failure.message)
 *
 * const dec = await client.decrypt(enc.data)
 * if (dec.failure) throw new Error(dec.failure.message)
 *
 * // Searchable encryption: mint a ciphertext-free QUERY TERM and cast it
 * // to the column's `eql_v3.query_<domain>` type in SQL to hit the index.
 * const term = await client.encryptQuery("alice@example.com", {
 *   column: users.email,
 *   table: users,
 *   queryType: "freeTextSearch",
 * })
 * if (term.failure) throw new Error(term.failure.message)
 * // e.g. postgres-js — bind `term.data`, NOT the envelope:
 * //   sql`SELECT * FROM users
 * //       WHERE eql_v3.matches(email, ${term.data}::jsonb::eql_v3.query_text_search)`
 * ```
 *
 * For per-user, identity-bound encryption on the edge, build an
 * `OidcFederationStrategy` (federates an end user's OIDC JWT — Clerk,
 * Supabase, … — into a CTS service token) and pass it via
 * `config.authStrategy`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { OidcFederationStrategy } from "@cipherstash/stack/wasm-inline"
 * import { cookieStore } from "@cipherstash/auth/cookies"
 *
 * // `create` returns a Result — UNWRAP it. `config.authStrategy` takes the
 * // strategy itself; handing it the Result fails later and opaquely.
 * const strategy = OidcFederationStrategy.create(
 *   "crn:ap-southeast-2.aws:my-workspace-id", () => getClerkSessionToken(req),
 *   { store: cookieStore({ request: req, responseHeaders }) },
 * )
 * if (strategy.failure) throw new Error(strategy.failure.error.message)
 *
 * const client = await Encryption({
 *   schemas, config: { authStrategy: strategy.data, clientId, clientKey },
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * For service-to-service / CI use with a custom token store, build an
 * `AccessKeyStrategy.create(workspaceCrn, accessKey, { store })` the same
 * way — same Result-unwrapping, and it derives the region from the CRN. Both
 * strategies are re-exported from this entry. An auth strategy and
 * `config.accessKey` are mutually exclusive.

 *
 * ## Every fallible method returns a Result
 *
 * `{ data } | { failure }`, with `failure.type` drawn from
 * `EncryptionErrorTypes` — the same contract the native entry honours, and
 * the one `AGENTS.md` states outright: *"Operations return `{ data }` or
 * `{ failure }`. Preserve this shape and error `type` values in
 * `EncryptionErrorTypes`."*
 *
 * This entry THREW until #741. That was drift, not a design decision: nothing
 * about WASM prevents it (`@byteslice/result` is already bundled into
 * `dist/wasm-inline.js` — see `tsup.config.ts` `noExternal`), and the
 * divergence just meant edge code had to be written in a different shape from
 * every other surface, with failures that were easy to miss. Aligned before
 * 1.0 so it never had to be a breaking change afterwards.
 *
 * `isEncrypted` is the one exception, and stays a plain `boolean`: it is a
 * pure predicate with nothing to fail at, exactly as on the native entry.
 *
 * The model helpers run the SAME traversal the native entry uses
 * (`@/encryption/helpers/model-traversal` — shared, not ported, so the two
 * entries cannot drift on which fields get encrypted), and each call is one
 * ZeroKMS round trip regardless of how many fields or models it covers. What
 * still differs from the native surface is deliberate and local: failures come
 * back as this entry's `{ failure }` Results (rather than a thenable operation
 * with `.audit()`).
 *
 * There is also no `.withLockContext()` here, and that one is a **gap, not a
 * design decision** (#797). An earlier version of this comment said
 * identity-bound encryption is "configured at client construction via
 * `config.authStrategy` instead" (#663 context). That is wrong, and the
 * conflation is worth naming because it is the one people arrive with:
 * an auth strategy decides WHO THE CLIENT IS; a lock context decides WHO CAN
 * RETRIEVE A VALUE'S DATA KEY (the claim from the encrypting caller's service
 * token is bound to the key, and retrieval requires presenting the same
 * claim). They are orthogonal, and only the first exists on this entry.
 *
 * The consequences are silent, which is why they are stated here rather than
 * left to a failed decrypt: values written from this entry carry no identity
 * condition on key retrieval — any client with keyset access can decrypt
 * them — even when the client is authenticated as an end user, and this
 * entry cannot read anything the native entry wrote under a lock context,
 * since key retrieval requires the same claim. `skills/stash-auth` is
 * canonical for the model; `skills/stash-edge` documents this entry's gap.
 *
 * The binding accepts a lock context on both paths — `lockContext` is an
 * option field on the single calls and per-payload-item on the bulk ones — so
 * closing this is plumbing rather than a new capability. It is not plumbed
 * here yet, and shipping it would want a live round-trip test first: a wrong
 * or missing claim surfaces as a failed decrypt, not a key error.
 *
 * Construct via {@link Encryption} — the constructor is private to
 * prevent callers from wrapping arbitrary objects in this type.

   * ## Partial failure
   *
   * The underlying primitive is `decryptBulkFallible`, which reports success

   * `{ failure }`, but its message names EVERY failed index and reason rather
   * than surfacing the first and discarding the rest. So a caller debugging
   * one bad row in a page of 50 learns which row, and that the other 49 were
   * fine.
   *
   * (A per-item `Result[]` would preserve the partial success too, and is

   * type from every other method here, so it is not the default.)

   * Same boundary as {@link decrypt}: date-like columns arrive as their stored

   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const rows = await sql`SELECT email FROM users LIMIT 50`
   * const emails = await client.bulkDecrypt(rows.map((r) => r.email))
   * if (emails.failure) throw new Error(emails.failure.message)
   * // one ZeroKMS call, not 50
   * ```
   *
   * @param ciphertexts - Stored payloads; `null`/`undefined` entries allowed.
   * @returns `{ data }` with an index-aligned array of plaintexts (`null` per

   * nested fields via a column's dotted path (`'profile.ssn'`) — and encrypts
   * exactly the declared fields. Everything else passes through untouched,
   * and a `null`/`undefined` schema field is preserved as-is without
   * reaching ZeroKMS. The traversal is the native entry's own, shared from
   * `@/encryption/helpers/model-traversal` (#742): a column added to the
   * schema is picked up by construction, instead of by remembering to extend
   * a hand-written `bulkEncrypt` mapping — the failure mode of that mapping
   * is a field that silently persists in PLAINTEXT.
   *
   * `Date` plaintexts (date/timestamp domains) are sent as ISO-8601 strings —
   * {@link WasmPlaintext} carries no `Date` across the WASM serde boundary —
   * and {@link decryptModel} rebuilds them into `Date` values on the way out.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const row = await client.encryptModel(
   *   { id: 1, email: "alice@example.com", verified: true },
   *   users,
   * )
   * if (row.failure) throw new Error(row.failure.message)
   * // row.data = { id: 1, email: <EQL envelope>, verified: true }

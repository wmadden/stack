# CipherStash Stack - Supabase Integration

Guide for integrating CipherStash field-level encryption with Supabase using
the `encryptedSupabase` wrapper over native EQL v3 column domains. The
wrapper provides transparent encryption on mutations and decryption on
selects, with support for equality, range, and ordering.

> **Naming note.** `encryptedSupabase` is the current EQL v3 factory.
> `encryptedSupabaseV3` remains as a `@deprecated`, type-identical alias, so
> existing imports keep working — prefer `encryptedSupabase` in new code. The
> old EQL v2 authoring wrapper (`encryptedSupabase({ encryptionClient,
> supabaseClient }).from(table, schema)`) has been **removed** — see
> "Legacy: EQL v2" at the end.

## When to Use This Skill

- Adding field-level encryption to a Supabase project
- Querying encrypted data with Supabase's query builder (eq, gt, in, or, etc.)
- Understanding encrypted JSON query limitations in PostgREST
- Inserting, updating, or upserting encrypted data
- Using identity-aware encryption (lock contexts) with Supabase
- Building applications where sensitive columns need encryption at rest and in transit

## Installation

```bash
npm install @cipherstash/stack @cipherstash/stack-supabase @supabase/supabase-js
```

> **Version note:** `npx stash init` is the preferred install path — it pins
> every `@cipherstash/*` package to the versions matching your CLI release.
> If you install manually as above, verify what actually resolved
> (`node -p "require('@cipherstash/stack/package.json').version"`): bare
> dist-tag installs can lag behind a release, and `stash init` will warn on
> the version skew.

The Supabase integration ships as its own first-party package,
`@cipherstash/stack-supabase`, which depends on `@cipherstash/stack`. Install both.

## Setup

**Credentials first:** for local development run `npx stash init` (the
agent-assisted flow — auth, schema, and database end to end) or
`npx stash auth login` (device code flow; no environment variables needed).
CI and production use the `CS_*` machine-credential environment variables —
see the `stash-encryption` skill's Configuration section. Mint them from your
device session with `npx stash env --name <name>` (no dashboard copy-paste);
this is also how **Supabase Edge Functions** get credentials in local dev —
`supabase functions serve` runs in a container that cannot see
`~/.cipherstash`, so write the vars to a file with
`stash env --name edge-dev --write` and pass `--env-file`, or
`supabase secrets set` them for deploys.

> **One credential set per environment — but what must match between writers
> and query readers is the keyset, not the credential string.** Index terms
> come from a per-*keyset* key, so any client bound to the keyset produces
> matching terms. Decrypt is looser — it follows each payload's keyset and
> needs only a grant — so a reader granted the writer's keyset but bound to
> a different one decrypts fine while its searches silently return zero
> rows. `stash-zerokms` is canonical for keyset scoping, `stash-auth` for
> credentials. Encryption *inside* an
> Edge Function (Deno, no native modules) uses the
> `@cipherstash/stack/wasm-inline` entry — see the `stash-edge` skill; SQL
> written by hand in a migration or RPC is covered by `stash-postgres`.

### 1. Install EQL v3 on the database

Install it as a **migration**, not directly:

```bash
stash eql migration --supabase   # writes supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_cipherstash_eql.sql
supabase db reset                # local — replays every migration
supabase db push                 # remote/linked project
```

> A bare `supabase migration up` applies to the **local** database. The remote
> forms are `supabase db push` and `supabase migration up --linked`.

> ⚠️ **Do not use `stash eql install --supabase` on a project with a local
> `supabase/` directory.** It applies the SQL straight to the running database,
> and `supabase db reset` — the ordinary local development loop — drops that
> database and replays `supabase/migrations/`. EQL is not in there, so it is
> gone, and the next query fails with `type "eql_v3_encrypted" does not exist`.
> `stash eql install --supabase` is for a **hosted** project you administer
> without the Supabase CLI, where there is no migrations directory to write to.

The generated file carries three things, in order: the EQL v3 bundle, the role
grants, and the `cipherstash.cs_migrations` tracking schema that `stash
encrypt` records per-column progress in. One `supabase db reset` therefore
provisions everything — no out-of-band `stash eql install` afterwards.

It refuses to write a second install migration; pass `--force` to regenerate
the existing one in place (same version, so an applied ledger stays consistent).
Because the version is unchanged, `supabase db push` will **not** re-apply it —
the Supabase CLI decides what is pending by version, never by file content, so a
version already in the ledger is never re-run and push reports `Remote database
is up to date.` Re-apply with `supabase db reset` locally; on a remote, clear
the ledger row first with `supabase migration repair --status reverted
<version>` (tracking table only — it applies no SQL) and then `supabase db
push`. Add `--include-all` to that push only if it aborts with `Found local
migration files to be inserted before the last migration on remote database.`,
which happens when migrations sort after the install; reverting the newest
version leaves it at the tail, where a plain push applies it. The flag applies
every out-of-order migration you have, so don't reach for it pre-emptively.
⚠️ On a populated database, weigh it first: the EQL
bundle opens with `DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS eql_v3 CASCADE` (and
`eql_v3_internal`), so re-applying also drops every index, constraint, and RLS
policy that references those schemas.

**If you already have encrypted-column migrations**, note that the generated
install is stamped with the current time and therefore sorts *after* them. A
reset replays in version order with no dependency awareness, so those migrations
run before EQL exists and `supabase db reset` fails with `type
"eql_v3_text_search" does not exist`. The command detects this and warns, naming
the files; the fix is to rename the install migration to a version below the
earliest of them. How that back-dated version reaches a remote depends on what
that remote actually has. This case only arises on a project that ran `stash eql
install` directly, so the remote usually has EQL already — but "usually" is not
what you want to bet a ledger row on, so check it:

```bash
psql "$REMOTE_DATABASE_URL" -Atc "select eql_v3.version()"
```

`eql_v3.version()` is created by the bundle's last statements, so it answers "is
the whole install there". A probe for the `eql_v3` schema does not: that schema
is created by the bundle's first statements and survives an install that aborted
partway.

If it prints a version, only the ledger row is missing — mark it applied with
`supabase migration repair --status applied <version>`, which writes the row and
runs no SQL. ⚠️ Do not push the file there instead: that re-runs the bundle's
opening `DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS eql_v3 CASCADE` (and `eql_v3_internal`), dropping
every index, constraint, and RLS policy that references those schemas.

If it errors, that remote genuinely still needs the SQL applied: `supabase db
push --include-all`, the flag being required because the back-dated version is a
gap in the middle of that history. ⚠️ Never mark it applied there. Every other
remedy on this page fails loudly and can be retried; this one fails silently —
the ledger row claims SQL that never ran, so no later push installs EQL, and the
first query against an encrypted column fails with nothing pointing at the
cause.

There is no `--out` to reach for here: the Supabase CLI's migrations directory
is not configurable. `supabase db reset` and `supabase db push` read
`<project>/supabase/migrations` and nothing else, `config.toml` has no key for
it, and `--workdir` / `SUPABASE_WORKDIR` moves the whole `supabase/` directory
rather than this subdirectory. `stash eql migration --supabase --out <dir>`
still writes the file, and warns, because a project may have its own step that
applies that directory — but the Supabase CLI will not, so EQL is gone again
after the next reset.

Since eql-3.0.0 there is **one** v3 SQL artifact for every target — there is
no separate Supabase variant. The bundle's only superuser-requiring
statements (the ORE operator class/family) skip themselves when the install
role lacks the privilege, and the bundle then disables the ORE-opclass-backed
domains it cannot support. `--supabase` adds the role grants for `anon` /
`authenticated` / `service_role` on the two schemas the bundle creates —
`eql_v3` (the operator-backing functions) and `eql_v3_internal` (SEM
internals). Without the grants, encrypted queries fail loudly with a
permission error (e.g. `permission denied for schema eql_v3_internal`).

No **Exposed schemas** change is needed: the column domains and their
operators live in `public`, so bare `col = term` filters resolve under
Supabase's default PostgREST configuration. Do not expose `eql_v3_internal`.

### Indexing encrypted columns (no superuser needed)

Encrypted columns can and should be **indexed** on Supabase. Index creation
needs no superuser — only the ORE opclass behind the `_ord_ore` domains is
restricted (and those domains are disabled on non-superuser installs anyway);
the default equality / ordering / match / containment indexes all install as
a normal role. Do not read the ORE warning as "encrypted columns can't be
indexed on Supabase."

Put the `CREATE INDEX` statements in a `supabase/migrations/` file, one index
per capability the column's domain carries:

```sql
-- eql_v3_text_eq / eql_v3_text_search: equality
CREATE INDEX users_email_eq ON users USING btree (eql_v3.eq_term(email));
-- eql_v3_<t>_ord / eql_v3_text_search: ordering + range (on numeric/date/
-- timestamp _ord domains this one index serves = too; text_ord needs the
-- eq_term index above as well)
CREATE INDEX users_created_at_ord ON users USING btree (eql_v3.ord_term(created_at));
-- eql_v3_text_match / eql_v3_text_search: free-text match
CREATE INDEX users_bio_match ON users USING gin (eql_v3.match_term(bio));
-- eql_v3_json_search: containment
CREATE INDEX users_profile_json
  ON users USING gin ((eql_v3.to_ste_vec_query(profile)::jsonb) jsonb_path_ops);

ANALYZE users;
```

The `ANALYZE` is part of the recipe — an expression index has no statistics
until it runs. For the full model (which domains take which index, engagement
rules, `EXPLAIN` verification, rollout timing), see the `stash-indexing` skill.

### 2. Database schema (per-domain columns)

Each encrypted column is declared with a concrete `public.eql_v3_*` domain —
the domain encodes both the plaintext type and the column's query
capabilities. There is no extension to enable and no generic `jsonb` column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email public.eql_v3_text_search,        -- eq + range + free-text search
  amount public.eql_v3_integer_ord,       -- eq + range
  joined_at public.eql_v3_timestamp_ord,  -- eq + range, decrypts to Date
  payload public.eql_v3_json_search,             -- encrypted JSON document
  role VARCHAR(50),                       -- regular plaintext column
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The `types.*` member name (see declared schemas below) maps to the flat
`public.eql_v3_<name>` domain — strip the `eql_v3_` prefix and PascalCase
each `_`-separated segment: `types.TextEq` → `public.eql_v3_text_eq`,
`types.IntegerOrd` → `public.eql_v3_integer_ord`. The domains use
SQL-standard type names (`integer`, `smallint`, `real`, `double`, `boolean`,
`timestamp`).

### 3. Initialize the wrapper

```typescript
import { encryptedSupabase } from "@cipherstash/stack-supabase"

// Introspects the database via options.databaseUrl or DATABASE_URL
const es = await encryptedSupabase(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey)
// or wrap an existing client: await encryptedSupabase(supabaseClient, options)

await es.from("users").insert({ email: "a@b.com", amount: 30 })
await es.from("users").select("id, email, amount").eq("email", "a@b.com")
```

`encryptedSupabase` **introspects the database at connect time**: it
detects EQL v3 columns by their Postgres domain, derives each column's
encryption config from the domain, and builds the encryption client
internally — there is no client-side schema to hand-maintain. Introspection
needs a direct Postgres connection (`options.databaseUrl`, defaulting to
`DATABASE_URL`), so the factory cannot run in a Worker or the browser.

Options: `{ schemas?, databaseUrl?, config? }` — `config` is the encryption
client config (e.g. `config.authStrategy`, see Authentication below).

`from(tableName)` takes only the table name — no schema argument. Column
capabilities come from the introspected domains.

### 4. Optional declared schemas (compile-time types)

Declaring tables is optional. Passing `schemas` — a record whose keys must
equal each table's name — adds compile-time types and verifies the declared
tables against the database at construction:

```typescript
import { encryptedTable, types } from "@cipherstash/stack/eql/v3"
import { encryptedSupabase } from "@cipherstash/stack-supabase"

const users = encryptedTable("users", {
  email:  types.TextSearch("email"),      // public.eql_v3_text_search — eq + range + free-text
  amount: types.IntegerOrd("amount"),     // public.eql_v3_integer_ord — eq + range
  joined: types.TimestampOrd("joined_at") // public.eql_v3_timestamp_ord — eq + range, decrypts to Date
})

const es = await encryptedSupabase(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey, {
  schemas: { users },
})

const { data } = await es.from("users").select("id, email, joined").eq("email", "a@b.com")
```

A declared table gets a typed builder: rows infer each column's plaintext
type (`types.IntegerOrd` → `number`, `types.TimestampOrd` → `Date`),
storage-only columns are excluded from every filter method, and `order()` is
narrowed to orderable columns.
Undeclared tables behave exactly as with no `schemas` at all. Every v3 column
is fully described by its `types.*` factory — there are no capability or
tuning chains on v3 columns.

A JS property may map to a different DB column name
(`joined: types.TimestampOrd("joined_at")`) — filters, selects, and results
are translated automatically, and `date`/`timestamp` columns decrypt to real
`Date` objects.

## Insert (Encrypted Automatically)

```typescript
// Single insert
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .insert({
    email: "alice@example.com",  // encrypted automatically
    amount: 30,                  // encrypted automatically
    role: "admin",               // plaintext column, passed through
  })
  .select("id")

// Bulk insert
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .insert([
    { email: "alice@example.com", amount: 30, role: "admin" },
    { email: "bob@example.com", amount: 25, role: "user" },
  ])
  .select("id")
```

## Update (Encrypted Automatically)

```typescript
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .update({ email: "alice@new.example.com" })  // encrypted automatically
  .eq("id", 1)
  .select("id, email")
```

## Upsert

```typescript
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .upsert(
    { id: 1, email: "alice@example.com", role: "admin" },
    { onConflict: "id" },
  )
  .select("id, email")
```

## Select (Decrypted Automatically)

```typescript
// All columns — select('*') (and bare select()) expands to the
// introspected column list
const { data, error } = await es.from("users").select("*")

// Explicit columns
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .select("id, email, amount, role")
// data: [{ id: 1, email: "alice@example.com", amount: 30, role: "admin" }]

// Single result
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .select("id, email")
  .eq("id", 1)
  .single()

// Maybe single (returns null if no match)
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .select("id, email")
  .eq("email", "nobody@example.com")
  .maybeSingle()
// data: null
```

`select()` also accepts an optional second parameter: `select(columns, { head?: boolean, count?: 'exact' | 'planned' | 'estimated' })`.

## Query Filters

All filter values for encrypted columns are automatically encrypted before
the query executes. Filter operands are grouped by column and each column
group takes one `bulkEncrypt` crossing — a query filtering N distinct
encrypted columns makes N ZeroKMS calls, run in parallel.

### Equality Filters

```typescript
// Exact match (requires an equality-capable domain)
.eq("email", "alice@example.com")

// Not equal
.neq("email", "alice@example.com")

// IN array
.in("email", ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"])

// NULL check (no encryption needed). Use this for genuine null checks — a
// null operand passed to eq/neq is not rejected; it is forwarded unencrypted.
.is("email", null)
```

### Free-Text Search (`matches`)

The current EQL 3.0.4 release requires a typed `eql_v3.query_*` right operand
for encrypted free-text matching. PostgREST cannot express that cast, so
Supabase v3 `matches()` fails fast. This requirement began in EQL 3.0.2 and
remains in 3.0.4. Use the Drizzle or Prisma Next adapter, or expose a carefully
scoped SQL/RPC path. Plaintext `like`/`ilike` queries remain native PostgREST
operations.

### Range/Comparison Filters

```typescript
// Requires a range-capable domain (e.g. *_ord, text_search)
.gt("amount", 21)
.gte("amount", 18)
.lt("amount", 65)
.lte("amount", 100)
```

### Match (Multi-Column Equality)

```typescript
.match({ email: "alice@example.com", amount: 30 })
```

### OR Conditions

```typescript
// String format
.or("email.eq.alice@example.com,email.eq.bob@example.com")

// Structured format (more type-safe)
.or([
  { column: "email", op: "eq", value: "alice@example.com" },
  { column: "email", op: "eq", value: "bob@example.com" },
])
```

Both forms encrypt values for encrypted columns automatically.

### NOT Filter

```typescript
.not("email", "eq", "alice@example.com")
```

### Raw Filter

```typescript
.filter("email", "eq", "alice@example.com")
```

## Delete

```typescript
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .delete()
  .eq("id", 1)
```

## Transforms

These are passed through to Supabase directly:

```typescript
.order("email", { ascending: true })  // encrypted columns: see behaviour below
.limit(10)
.range(0, 9)
.abortSignal(signal)
.throwOnError()
.returns<U>()
```

`csv()` is the exception — it **throws**. PostgREST serializes rows
server-side, so a CSV response would carry ciphertext the wrapper never gets
to decrypt. Select rows normally and serialize the decrypted data yourself:

```typescript
const { data } = await es.from("users").select("id, email")
const csv = data!.map((r) => `${r.id},${r.email}`).join("\n")
```

`order()` works on plaintext columns and on OPE-backed encrypted ordering
columns — see the `order()` bullet in the next section for exactly which
domains qualify.

## Query behaviour on encrypted columns

All envelopes (stored payloads and filter operands) are versioned `v: 3`.

- **`select('*')` (and bare `select()`) works** — it expands to the
  introspected column list.
- **Encrypted free-text search is unavailable through PostgREST on the current
  EQL 3.0.4 release.**
  The SQL surface uses `@@` with an `eql_v3.query_*` right operand. PostgREST's
  filter grammar cannot express that cast; its `cs` operator is SQL `@>`, which
  EQL deliberately rejects for text-search domains. Do not use `matches()`,
  encrypted `like`/`ilike`, or raw `cs` as substitutes. `contains()` remains
  native exact jsonb/array containment on plaintext columns.
- **INTERIM — filter operands are full storage envelopes.** EQL ships
  term-only query domains (`eql_v3.query_<name>`, which accept envelopes with
  no ciphertext) and the encryption client can mint those narrowed terms, but
  PostgREST has no syntax to cast a filter value — an uncast operand can only
  reach the `jsonb` operator overload, which coerces it into the storage
  domain, whose CHECK requires ciphertext. So the adapter still encrypts each
  filter value with the full storage path. The call shape is unchanged.

  **Security caveat:** query terms are meant to be index-terms-only by
  design, but a full-envelope operand carries a real decryptable ciphertext
  `c` plus **all** of the column's index terms, and PostgREST filters travel
  in GET query strings — so these envelopes can land in URL logs,
  intermediate proxies, and Supabase request logs. The remaining gap is
  PostgREST operand casting; an adapter-side fix is tracked.
- **`order()` works on OPE-backed encrypted ordering columns** (every plain
  `*_ord` domain, plus `text_ord` and `text_search`). PostgREST cannot emit
  `ORDER BY eql_v3.ord_term(col)`, and a bare `ORDER BY` would silently sort
  the raw ciphertext envelope — so the builder instead emits `order=col->op`,
  sorting by the OPE term inside the envelope, which reproduces plaintext
  order (the term is fixed-width lowercase hex, so string comparison agrees
  with the bytea btree; pinned by `ope-term.integration.test.ts`). ORE-flavour
  columns (`*_ord_ore`) are rejected at compile time and runtime — their `ob`
  term needs the superuser-only operator class no jsonb path can reach — and
  columns with no ordering term (storage-only, equality-only, match-only)
  reject `order()` with a clear error. For those, order by a plaintext column
  or sort application-side after decrypting.
- **Storage-only domains are not filterable** (e.g. `types.Boolean`,
  `types.Text`): a filter (including `.match()`) on one is a type error on a
  declared table, and always a clear runtime error. `.is(column, null)`
  remains available.
- **Null filter operands are forwarded unencrypted, not rejected.** A null
  cannot be encrypted into an operand, so the builder skips encryption and
  passes the null through to PostgREST as-is (e.g. a `col=eq.null` filter),
  which is rarely what you want. Use `.is(column, null)` for genuine null
  checks — the builder does not throw.

## Encrypted JSON querying (`types.Json`)

A `types.Json("payload")` column (`public.eql_v3_json_search`) can be stored and
decrypted through Supabase, but EQL 3.0.4 requires an explicit
`eql_v3.query_json` cast for containment and value-selector equality.
PostgREST cannot express that cast. The wrapper therefore fails fast for
encrypted `contains()`, `selectorEq()`, and `selectorNe()` before encrypting a
query operand; it never places a decryptable JSON storage envelope in the GET
query string. Use Drizzle or Prisma Next for containment and selector equality
or ordering, or expose a carefully scoped SQL/RPC function.

Plaintext jsonb/array `contains()` remains a native PostgREST operation.

## Authentication

The encryption client authenticates to ZeroKMS through `config.authStrategy`.
Unset, it uses the default **auto** strategy — the `npx stash auth login`
profile in local development (preferred), `CS_*` environment variables in
CI/production — which is fine for service-level encryption. To authenticate **as the end user**, federate their
third-party OIDC JWT (Clerk, Supabase, Auth0, ...) with
`OidcFederationStrategy`:

```typescript
import { OidcFederationStrategy } from "@cipherstash/stack"
import { encryptedSupabase } from "@cipherstash/stack-supabase"

const strategy = OidcFederationStrategy.create(
  process.env.CS_WORKSPACE_CRN!,
  () => getUserJwt(), // re-invoked on every (re-)federation
)
if (strategy.failure) throw new Error(strategy.failure.error.message)

const es = await encryptedSupabase(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey, {
  config: { authStrategy: strategy.data },
})
```

Authentication stands on its own — an OIDC-authenticated client runs every
query normally. Binding *data* to the authenticated user is the optional next
step: the lock context.

## Identity-Aware Encryption (Lock Contexts)

Bind the data key to a claim from the end user's JWT by chaining
`.withLockContext({ identityClaim })` on a query. This **requires** an
`OidcFederationStrategy`-authenticated client (above) — the claim's value
resolves from the federated JWT; auto/access-key auth has no user JWT to
resolve claims from. Plain authentication never requires a lock context.

```typescript
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .insert({ email: "alice@example.com" })
  .withLockContext({ identityClaim: ["sub"] })
  .select("id")
```

`identityClaim` is an array of JWT claim *names* (`["sub"]`), not values; the same
claim must be presented to decrypt — the claim gates retrieval of the value's
data key at ZeroKMS. `.withLockContext()` also accepts a `LockContext`
instance. `stash-auth` is the canonical skill for the lock-context model and
the auth strategies.

> **Deprecated: `LockContext.identify()`.** Older code did
> `new LockContext().identify(userJwt)` to fetch a per-operation CTS token. Those
> tokens were removed in `protect-ffi` 0.25 and the fetched token is no longer
> used by encryption. Authenticate with `OidcFederationStrategy` and pass the
> claim directly, as above.

## Audit Logging

Chain `.audit()` to attach metadata for ZeroKMS audit logging:

```typescript
const { data, error } = await es
  .from("users")
  .select("id, email")
  .eq("email", "alice@example.com")
  .audit({ metadata: { action: "user-lookup", requestId: "abc-123" } })
```

## Complete Example

```typescript
import { encryptedTable, types } from "@cipherstash/stack/eql/v3"
import { encryptedSupabase } from "@cipherstash/stack-supabase"

// Optional declared schema — compile-time types. Introspection alone
// (no `schemas`) also works.
const users = encryptedTable("users", {
  email:  types.TextSearch("email"),
  amount: types.IntegerOrd("amount"),
})

const es = await encryptedSupabase(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
  { schemas: { users } }, // databaseUrl defaults to DATABASE_URL
)

// Insert — values encrypted automatically
await es.from("users").insert([
  { email: "alice@example.com", amount: 30 },
  { email: "bob@example.com", amount: 25 },
])

// Query with multiple filters — operands encrypted automatically
const { data } = await es
  .from("users")
  .select("id, email, amount")
  .gte("amount", 18)
  .lte("amount", 35)
  .eq("email", "alice@example.com")

// data is fully decrypted:
// [{ id: 1, email: "alice@example.com", amount: 30 }]
```

## Response Type

```typescript
type EncryptedSupabaseResponse<T> = {
  data: T | null                     // Decrypted rows
  error: EncryptedSupabaseError | null
  count: number | null
  status: number
  statusText: string
}
```

Errors can come from Supabase (API errors) or from encryption operations. Check `error.encryptionError` for encryption-specific failures.

The full `EncryptedSupabaseError` type:

```typescript
type EncryptedSupabaseError = {
  message: string
  details?: string       // Supabase error details
  hint?: string          // Supabase error hint
  code?: string          // Supabase/PostgreSQL error code
  encryptionError?: EncryptionError  // CipherStash encryption-specific error
}
```

## Filter to Domain Capability Mapping

The column's `public.eql_v3_*` domain determines which filters it accepts:

| Filter Method | Works On |
|---|---|
| `eq`, `neq`, `in`, `match()` | Equality-capable domains (`*_eq`, `*_ord`, `text_search`) |
| `matches()` / encrypted `contains()` / `selectorEq()` / `selectorNe()` | Unavailable through PostgREST on EQL 3.0.4; use Drizzle, Prisma Next, or scoped SQL/RPC |
| `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte` | Range-capable domains (`*_ord`, `text_search`) |
| `contains()` | Plaintext jsonb/array columns (native containment) |
| `order()` | OPE-backed ordering domains (plain `*_ord`, `text_ord`, `text_search`) — never `*_ord_ore` |
| `is` | Any column (no encryption; NULL check) |

Storage-only domains (e.g. `eql_v3_text`, `eql_v3_boolean`) accept no filters
at all — only `.is(column, null)`.

## Exported Types

`@cipherstash/stack-supabase` also exports the following types:

- `EncryptedSupabaseOptions`, `EncryptedSupabaseInstance`, `TypedEncryptedSupabaseInstance`, `EncryptedQueryBuilder`, `EncryptedQueryBuilderUntyped`, `EncryptedQueryBuilderCore`, `V3Schemas`
- `FilterableKeys`, `FreeTextSearchableKeys`
- `EncryptedSupabaseResponse`, `EncryptedSupabaseError`, `PendingOrCondition`, `SupabaseClientLike`

Each `*V3`-suffixed name from earlier releases (`EncryptedSupabaseV3Options`,
`EncryptedSupabaseV3Instance`, `TypedEncryptedSupabaseV3Instance`,
`EncryptedQueryBuilderV3`, `EncryptedQueryBuilderV3Untyped`, `V3FilterableKeys`,
`V3FreeTextSearchableKeys`) is still exported as a `@deprecated`, type-identical
alias of its unsuffixed counterpart above.

## Migrating an Existing Column to Encrypted

The hard case: a Supabase table that already exists with live data in a plaintext column you want to encrypt. You can't just change the column type — that would drop the data.

CipherStash splits this into two named steps with a hard production-deploy gate between them: an **encryption rollout** (schema-add + dual-write code) and an **encryption cutover** (backfill + switch reads to the encrypted column by name + drop). The `stash-encryption` skill is the canonical reference for the lifecycle; this section walks the Supabase-specific shape.

> **EQL version note.** The `stash encrypt *` tooling now mutates **EQL v3 only**. A `public.eql_v3_*` target is required for backfill and drop. Legacy `eql_v2_encrypted` columns and migration history remain visible in status, but mutation commands reject them. The v3 lifecycle is `rollout → deploy gate → backfill → switch the app to the encrypted column by name → drop`, with no rename.

> **Runner note.** `stash init` adds `stash` to the project as a dev dependency, so `stash <command>` runs through whichever package manager the project uses (Bun, pnpm, Yarn, or npm) — examples below show this bare form. Before init has run, prefix with your package manager's one-shot runner: `bunx`, `pnpm dlx`, `yarn dlx`, or `npx`. The CLI's behaviour is identical across all of them.

> **Where am I?** Run `stash status` first (substitute the runner per the note above). It shows you which tables/columns are mid-rollout, which are post-deploy, and what the next move is. Re-run after every transition.

### Starting state

You have:

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_initial.sql (already applied)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email text NOT NULL,             -- plaintext, populated, NOT NULL
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

…and an `await supabase.from('users').insert({ email })` somewhere in your app code.

### Step 1 — Encryption rollout (one PR, one deploy)

Everything below lands in one PR. The deploy of that PR is the gate.

#### Schema-add: declare the encrypted twin

Generate a Supabase migration:

```bash
supabase migration new add_users_email_encrypted
```

Edit the generated file to add an `email_encrypted` column **alongside** `email`. The encrypted column must be **nullable** at creation — never `NOT NULL`, because rows that already exist will have NULL in this column until backfill catches them.

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_add_users_email_encrypted.sql
ALTER TABLE users
  ADD COLUMN email_encrypted public.eql_v3_text_search;  -- nullable
```

Apply with `supabase db reset` locally or `supabase db push` against the
remote project. The reset is safe here because the EQL install is itself a
migration (step 1) — it is replayed before this one, so the `eql_v3_text_search`
domain exists by the time this `ALTER TABLE` runs.

No client-side schema change is required — `encryptedSupabase` introspects
the new column's domain at the next client startup. If you use declared
`schemas`, add the column so it is typed:

```typescript
// src/encryption/schema.ts (optional — compile-time types)
import { encryptedTable, types } from '@cipherstash/stack/eql/v3'

export const users = encryptedTable('users', {
  email_encrypted: types.TextSearch('email_encrypted'),
})
```

#### Dual-writing: write to both columns from app code

Find **every** code path that writes to `users.email` and update it to also write the encrypted twin. With the v3 wrapper this is a single insert: `email` is a plaintext column and passes through unchanged, while `email_encrypted` is a v3 domain column the wrapper encrypts automatically. Wrap it in one function so callers can't forget one half:

```typescript
// src/db/users.ts
import { es } from './clients' // encryptedSupabase instance

export async function insertUser(email: string) {
  return es.from('users').insert({
    email,                   // plaintext — keep writing
    email_encrypted: email,  // encrypted twin — new, encrypted automatically
  })
}
```

Same shape for UPDATE: every site that updates `email` must also update `email_encrypted` in the same statement.

**The dual-write rule.** Every persistence path that mutates this row writes both columns, in the same transaction, on every code branch. Insert sites, update sites, upserts, ON CONFLICT clauses, seeders, fixtures, edge functions, RPC functions, admin actions, background jobs, third-party webhooks — all of them. A single missed branch means rows inserted in production after deploy land in plaintext only, and backfill won't catch them. Grep for every site that touches `users.email` before declaring this step done.

After this phase, existing rows still have `email_encrypted = NULL`. Reads still come from `email`. Nothing has broken.

### ⛔ Deploy gate

Stop. Ship this PR to production. The deployed environment must be running the dual-write code before any cutover-step work is safe.

When the deploy is live:

```bash
stash status        # verify the rollout is recorded
stash plan          # detects dual-writes are live; drafts the cutover plan
```

`stash impl` will refuse to run a cutover-step plan if `cs_migrations` has no `dual_writing` event for `users.email`. That refusal is the safety net for cases where someone runs cutover work locally before the code is actually live.

### Step 2 — Encryption cutover

Once dual-writes are live in production and `cs_migrations` records `dual_writing`:

#### Backfill: encrypt the historical rows

```bash
stash encrypt backfill --table users --column email
# (Interactive: answer 'yes' to the dual-write confirmation prompt.)
# (CI: pass --confirm-dual-writes-deployed instead.)
```

Resumable, idempotent, chunked. The CLI walks the table in keyset-pagination order, encrypts each chunk via the encryption client, and writes the ciphertext into `email_encrypted` inside transactions that also checkpoint to `cs_migrations`. SIGINT-safe. It requires a `public.eql_v3_*` target and records EQL version 3; a legacy `eql_v2_encrypted` target is rejected before encryption begins.

If something goes wrong (e.g. you discover the dual-write code wasn't actually live when backfill ran), re-run with `--force` to re-encrypt every row regardless of current state.

#### Switch reads to the encrypted column

The EQL v3 encrypted column keeps its own name. Point the application at
`email_encrypted` through the `encryptedSupabase` wrapper, deploy, verify reads
decrypt correctly, then continue to the drop step. There is no rename command.

#### Drop: remove the plaintext column

Once read paths are routing through the wrapper and you're confident reads are decrypting correctly:

```bash
stash encrypt drop --table users --column email
```

The CLI emits an EQL v3 drop migration for the original plaintext column,
`email`. There was no rename, so no `email_plaintext` exists. The SQL is not a
bare `ALTER TABLE`: it is a `DO $stash_drop$` block that takes `LOCK TABLE users
IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE`, re-counts rows where `email IS NOT NULL AND
email_encrypted IS NULL` at apply time, raises if any remain, and only then
drops the column. It requires the `backfilled` phase plus a live coverage check
at generation time. Legacy v2 state is rejected.

Review and apply with `supabase db reset` locally, or `supabase db push` against the remote project. Then remove the dual-write code from app paths — the plaintext column is gone; only the encrypted column is written now, through the wrapper.

### Inspecting progress at any time

```bash
stash status         # quest log: where each rollout is, what to do next
stash encrypt status # raw per-column phase, EQL state, backfill progress
stash encrypt plan   # diffs your migrations.json intent vs observed state
```

All three are read-only.

## Legacy: EQL v2

Earlier versions of this integration stored ciphertext in composite
`eql_v2_encrypted` columns (enabled via `CREATE EXTENSION eql_v2` or the v2 EQL
bundle) and both wrote and read them through the `encryptedSupabase({
supabaseClient, encryptionClient })` factory — a hand-written client-side schema
and a two-argument `from(tableName, schema)`.

**That v2 wrapper has been removed.** `@cipherstash/stack-supabase` now authors
and queries EQL v3 only, via the introspecting `encryptedSupabase(url, key)` /
`encryptedSupabase(client, options)` factory described above. There is no longer
a code path in this package that emits or reads `eql_v2_encrypted` columns.

Passing a v2 table in `schemas` is rejected by name:

```
[supabase v3]: schemas entry "users" is an EQL v2 table — it has no
buildColumnKeyMap(), the marker every v3 table carries.
```

A v2 `encryptedTable` is structurally identical to a v3 one apart from that
marker, so TypeScript alone will not always catch the swap — re-author the table
with `encryptedTable`/`types` from `@cipherstash/stack/eql/v3`.

Existing v2 deployments should add an `eql_v3_*` twin column and run the rollout
in "Migrating an Existing Column to Encrypted" above. Current `stash` releases
do not install EQL v2 or mutate its Proxy configuration, backfill, rename, or
drop lifecycle. They retain read-only status and manifest diagnostics so the
legacy state remains visible. For dump recovery, use the upstream EQL 2.3.1 SQL
release; do not treat it as a supported new-install path.

For the removed v2 wrapper's historical API and semantics, see the docs at
https://cipherstash.com/docs.

/**
 * GitHub Actions has no YAML anchors, so a workflow that wants the same
 * `paths:` filter on `push` and `pull_request` has to write the list twice.
 * Nothing makes the copies agree, and a one-sided edit is silent in the worst
 * direction: drop an entry from the `pull_request` copy and the workflow keeps
 * running on `main`, keeps reporting green, and stops running on the pull
 * request — which is the only run that could have caught the change before it
 * landed. The reverse edit is loud by comparison; you notice a job that never
 * runs on main.
 *
 * This invariant is NOT integration-specific, and for a long time the check was.
 * It lived in `integration-workflow-paths.test.mjs`, whose discovery selects
 * workflows by their `CS_IT_SUITE` globs — two files today. The other seven
 * workflows that write the list twice were covered by nothing, including the
 * two prisma e2e workflows whose own comments (until this file existed) claimed
 * otherwise. Generalising it costs nothing: all nine were already identical, so
 * the widened check went green on the first run and the coverage roughly
 * quadrupled.
 *
 * The comparison is on the PARSED lists, not the text. Comments between entries,
 * ordering of unrelated keys and quoting style are all free to differ; only the
 * sequence of path globs has to match, because only that is what GitHub reads.
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY CASE is the interesting half. A workflow declaring `paths:` on
 * one event and not the other has no second copy to compare, so it drops out of
 * the parity check entirely — and "drops out of the check" is exactly what a
 * one-sided DELETION looks like. `tests-rust.yml` is a legitimate instance and
 * therefore the reason the expected-asymmetry map below is not just an
 * exemption but a fixed list: a tenth workflow arriving in that state has to be
 * justified in writing rather than quietly stop being checked.

 * "unfiltered", which is a different thing from an empty list and a very

/**
 * An integration workflow only runs when its `paths:` filter matches the diff.
 * So a source directory that the selected suites import, but that no `paths:`
 * entry covers, is live coverage that silently does not run: edit only that
 * directory and the job the code depends on never starts.
 *
 * `packages/stack/src/dynamodb/**` was exactly that (#815 review). The only
 * live EQL v2 read coverage in the repo lives in
 * `integration/shared/v2-decrypt-compat.integration.test.ts`, which exercises
 * the DynamoDB legacy read path — and `grep -rn dynamodb .github/` returned
 * nothing at all, so a change to that path (or a `protect-ffi` bump that broke
 * v2 deserialization) would not have run it.
 *
 * Rather than hardcode "dynamodb must be listed", this derives the requirement:
 * whatever the selected suites import via the `@/` alias must be covered. A new
 * import in an integration suite therefore fails here until the filter follows.
 *
 * The same argument applies to what the suites import from OUTSIDE the repo.
 * Those v2 suites mint their fixtures with `@cipherstash/protect-ffi` directly,
 * and a bump of that native module edits only a dependency manifest — no source
 * directory — so it too must appear in the filter. `importedDependencyManifests`
 * derives which manifest that is (package manifest for exact pins,
 * `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for `catalog:` ones).
 *
 * The third property this file used to hold — that the `push` and
 * `pull_request` copies of each filter are identical, GitHub Actions having no
 * YAML anchors — now lives in `workflow-paths-filter-parity.test.mjs`. It was
 * never integration-specific, and holding it here scoped it to the discovery
 * below: two workflows, out of the nine that write the list twice. The two it
 * did cover are covered there.

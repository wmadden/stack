/**
 * A build that copies `skills/` must declare `skills/` as an input.
 *
 * `packages/cli` and `packages/wizard` both `cpSync('../../skills',
 * 'dist/skills')` — they consume a directory outside their own package, which
 * turbo's `$TURBO_DEFAULT$` does not cover. On its own that only meant a stale
 * cache entry stayed valid; once `build` declared `outputs: ["dist/**"]`, a
 * cache hit began actively RESTORING the previous `dist/skills` over the tree.
 *
 * `skills/` ships inside the `stash` and `@cipherstash/wizard` tarballs and
 * `stash init` copies it into customer repos, so the failure mode is publishing
 * guidance that was edited but never rebuilt — invisible, because the build is
 * green and the source file on disk is correct.
 *
 * Verified by hand at the time of writing: edit a `SKILL.md`, run
 * `turbo run build --filter=stash`, observe FULL TURBO and a `dist/skills` copy
 * without the edit. This pins the fix so it cannot silently come undone.

// action that does not exist, and at job level "a remote reusable workflow"
// describes something remote, which this is not. It is an invalid reference,

const PARENT_USES = /^\.\.\//

// ALLOWLIST RATIONALE — why this is a list of what is permitted, and not a
// longer list of cache actions.
//
// The rules above only see two things: an action literally named
// `actions/cache*`, and an action that takes a `cache:` input. A third-party
// cache action has neither, so it was invisible to the whole file. Reproduced
// against a composite reached from a targeted workflow holding
// `useblacksmith/cache@v5` and `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2`: `OK`, exit 0. Both are
// live-relevant here — eleven jobs in this repo run on `blacksmith-*` runners,
// where `useblacksmith/cache` is the documented drop-in for `actions/cache`,
// and the absorbed Cargo workspace at `packages/protect-ffi` is exactly where
// someone reaches for `Swatinem/rust-cache`.
//
// The obvious repair is to enumerate the cache actions — by name
// (`useblacksmith/cache`, `buildjet/cache`, `runs-on/cache`, `tespkg/actions-
// cache`, …) or by name shape (does the path contain "cache"?). Both were
// rejected, for the same reason:
//
//   A denylist fails OPEN on the action nobody has met yet. It is silently
//   correct until the day it is silently wrong, and it is wrong in the
//   direction that prints `OK`. That is this repo's own stated criticism of
//   its own checks — "a check that never ran reads exactly like a check that
//   passed" — and it applies with full force to a list of vendor names that
//   grows without this repo hearing about it.
//
// Worse, neither denylist form covers the class most likely to be added here by
// accident: a `setup-<tool>` action that caches BY DEFAULT, with no `cache:`
// input to inspect and no "cache" anywhere in its name.
// `gradle/actions/setup-gradle` is one; a runner vendor's drop-in `setup-node`
// is another. This file already carries two hand-maintained members of that
// class — `pnpm/action-setup` and `actions/setup-node` above — and they are
// here only because somebody happened to notice. Nothing would have caught the
// third.
//
// So the rule is inverted. Every REMOTE `uses:` reachable from a targeted
// workflow must appear below, or it is reported. This fails CLOSED: an action
// this gate has never seen is a finding by default, whatever it is called and
// whatever inputs it takes.
//
// This does not go stale silently, which is the whole point of choosing it. An
// allowlist's staleness is a build failure naming the exact action and the file
// it was added to — the person adding it is the person told to audit it, in the
// same PR. A denylist's staleness is an `OK`.
//
// The cost is bounded and was measured before choosing it, not assumed. The two
// targeted workflows are deliberately minimal and reach exactly four actions
// between them (all four are below); traversal is target-scoped, so nothing
// outside what release.yml and tests-supply-chain.yml reach is constrained; and
// they reach no local composite and no reusable workflow today. Adding an
// action to the npm-publishing workflow costs one line here plus a sentence
// saying why — which is the review that workflow warrants regardless.
//
// LOCAL `uses:` IS EXEMPT, and deliberately so: this gate opens a `./` action
// and reads every one of its steps, so it is audited by construction rather
// than trusted. Listing it here would report the composite and bury the
// `actions/cache` inside it — the finding that actually matters.
const AUDITED_ACTIONS = new Set([
  // First-party checkout. No cache of its own.

  // Both cache on request only, and the explicit-`false` rules above assert
  // that these two are told not to — they are on this list *and* separately
  // constrained.

// A secondary, deliberately over-broad read of the action's name. It is NOT the
// defence — the allowlist above is, and it already rejects everything this
// matches. This exists for two narrower jobs:
//
//  1. Message quality. `useblacksmith/cache@v5` should read as "this restores a
//     cache", not "this is not on a list" — the second invites adding it to the
//     list.
//  2. Guarding the allowlist against itself. The one careless edit that could
//     re-open this hole is someone appending a cache action to AUDITED_ACTIONS,
//     so the assertion below makes that impossible: no entry may be
//     cache-shaped, checked on every single invocation.
//
// Substring, not segment-equality, and that was verified rather than assumed:
// `Swatinem/rust-cache` has no path segment equal to `cache`, so
// `/(^|\/)cache(\/|$)/` misses it while a substring catches it — along with
// `tespkg/actions-cache` and any `*-cache` / `cache-*` naming a vendor picks.
